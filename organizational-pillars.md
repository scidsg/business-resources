# üèõÔ∏è Organizational Pillars
We've built our organization on four key pillars: accessibility, privacy, usability, and open-source.

## Open Source
Our organization supports the open-source philosophy, emphasizing generosity, transparency, and community over profits and corporate secrecy. Open-source operationalizes our values as a community and provides a more equitable and accessible technology ecosystem for everyone, not just those with financial resources.

## Usability
Usability is essential for ensuring that people will use and adopt technology. A software solution that is not user-friendly is unlikely to be successful, even if it is open-source.

## Privacy
Privacy is consent - it gives people the choice and control over what they want to reveal about themselves to the world. We believe that users should have the right to decide what companies can do with their personal information. Google is usable, but it's far from private. We need to do better.

## Accessibility
Accessibility ensures that individuals with disabilities can use and interact with technology. This includes using assistive technologies such as screen readers or braille displays. We believe that excluding individuals who need such technologies from basic online activities is unethical and, in many cases, illegal. If software is open-source, usable, and private but is inaccessible, it's *still* not ready for the world.
