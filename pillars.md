# Organizational Pillars

## Accessibility
Accessible software helps individuals that need assistive technologies interact with the world. It could be a wheelchair to get around your city, or a screen reader to use an app that you need. Without accessible software, our neighbors that are most in need can't do basic things online like access their bank, send a text, or call a friend. In the feature-factories of Big Tech, accessibility is often low on the priority list and ends up as a zombie on a product's backlog. We think this is unethical, in many cases illegal, and shows just how far removed from the customer most businesses are. Even if an app is open-source, usable, and private, but not everyone can use it, it's not ready to release.

## Privacy
Privacy is consent. It's the choice of what you want to reveal about yourself. If a business were looking through your windows, we'd be appaled. But effectively this is what's happening when companies don't give you the choice of how they use or store your data. Even if an app is usable but isn't private, we're not interested. 

## Usability
Usability is table stakes. If it's not usable, people will not use it. If you're making something open-source but it isn't usable, adoption is going to be a mountain to climb.

## Open Source
Open source is a philosophy and a way of thinking. It prioritizes generosity, transparency, and community over greed, secrecy, and profits. It operationalizes our values as a community and helps to build a more ecosystem that benefits everyone, not just those with money.
