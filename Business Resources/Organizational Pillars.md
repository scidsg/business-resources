# Organizational Pillars

## Open Source
Our organization supports the open-source philosophy, emphasizing generosity, transparency, and community over profits and corporate secrecy. Open-source operationalizes our values as a community and provides a more equitable and accessible technology ecosystem for everyone, not just those with financial resources.

## Usability
Usability is essential for ensuring that people will use and adopt technology. A software solution that is not user-friendly is unlikely to be successful, even if it is open-source.

## Privacy
Privacy is consent - it gives people the choice and control over what they want to reveal about themselves to the world. We believe that users should have the right to decide what companies can do with their personal information. Google is usable, but it's far from private. We need to do better.

## Accessibility
Accessibility ensures that individuals requiring assistive technologies such as screen readers or braille displays can interact with digital products. We believe that excluding individuals who need such technologies from basic online activities is unethical and, in many cases, illegal. If software is open-source, usable, and private but is inaccessible, it's still not ready for the world.

## Worker Equity
If you do work for US companies operating in US markets, you deserve a US wage. Full stop. The budget for hiring four people in the US shouldn't enable hiring 40 people abroad. This is exploitation, plain and simple. Science & Design pays everyone the same rate based on the market we're serving, no matter where they live.

## Worker Autonomy
We base our pay on a 4-day work week and a 10-month work year. There are deadlines, deliverables, and the occasional meeting, but if you can get all of your work done in two days, late at night, go for it. Companies shouldn't prescribe when and how someone completes their work. And PTO? You own your own time, not us. Never ask permission.

## Non-Hierarchy
Hierarchy, by definition, removes the autonomy of everyone at the bottom. And by now, we should know that those at the top do the most damage. This old trope stifles creativity and momentum, creates a class system that is often exploited, and crushes the morale of those without influence. Leadership is a quality, not a title.
