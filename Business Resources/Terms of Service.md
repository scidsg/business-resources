# Terms of Service

1. **Nature of our Service:** We are an assembly of software development experts, collaborating to support public interest causes. Our focus is on building outstanding software, particularly in areas promoting freedom of press, internet freedom, activism, LGBTQ+ rights, and accessibility technology. Our service does not resemble that of a staffing agency or a collection of hired hands. We are engaged for the value of our expertise and knowledge, not simply to augment your staff.

2. **Staff Augmentation Service:** While our primary role is not that of a staffing agency, we do offer staff augmentation services under certain conditions. The cost for such services is priced at twice the regular rate, due to the added responsibility and commitment. If you require staffing services, you agree to provide the necessary management, as our primary role is to provide experts and not to manage teams.

3. **Commitment to Full-Time Staffing:** We recognize the significance of consistent, long-term engagement for our experts. Therefore, staffing services require a non-revocable one-year agreement. This condition ensures secure payment for an individual hired full-time on your team and reinforces our belief in the stability and respect of professional careers.

4. **Employee Rights and Expertise:** We place a high value on the rights of employees and their expertise. We don't view our relationships with employers as hierarchical, but as partnerships. Our experts are hired for their skills, knowledge, and expertise. If you find their work not to your liking, it does not qualify as failure to meet contractual obligations.

5. **Conflict Resolution:** We are not mediators or managers. If you encounter difficulty in working relationships with any individual we have placed with you, it is incumbent upon you to manage and resolve the situation. Disagreements or conflicts do not constitute a failure to meet contractual obligations on our part.

6. **Management and Mediation Services:** If you require management or mediation services, such services are offered at three times our normal rate. This is due to the complex and time-consuming nature of these services, which extends beyond our core area of expertise.

7. **Rush Work Fees:** In the event that you require urgent work (defined as a request made with less than 30 working days' notice), a rush cost multiplier will be applied. This is calculated on a scale where 30 days notice incurs a 1.25 multiplier, while a one-day notice would incur a 4 multiplier. This is to account for the additional resources and expedited process needed to meet your short-notice requirements.

8. **Administrative Fees:** To cover the administrative costs associated with running our organization, we apply a 10% administrative fee to all grants, contracts, or other forms of paid engagement. These fees assist with the general operational costs of our nonprofit organization, enabling us to continue providing our services and promoting public interest causes. By engaging with us, you acknowledge and agree to this administrative fee.

We believe these terms reflect our commitment to professional integrity, respect for our team's expertise, and the value we place on open, transparent relationships with our clients. By engaging with us, you agree to these terms, recognizing that we are here to build great software and make a meaningful impact on public interest causes.
