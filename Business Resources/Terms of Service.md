# Terms of Service

We're delighted you've chosen to work with us. Our guiding principle is to build outstanding software for public interest causes, and we hope to establish a meaningful and transparent relationship with you. As we set out on this journey together, there are a few terms of our service that we'd like you to be aware of.

1. **Our Specialization:** We are a collective of software development experts, working collaboratively to make a positive impact, particularly in areas such as freedom of press, internet freedom, activism, LGBTQ+ rights, and accessibility technology. We're not a staffing agency; we're a team of professionals who bring a wealth of knowledge and expertise to your projects.

2. **Staff Augmentation:** While we primarily focus on software development, we understand that there may be times when you need to supplement your team. If required, we can provide staff augmentation services, priced at twice our regular rate to reflect the added responsibilities.

3. **Long-term Engagements:** If you need our experts to be a full-time part of your team, we ask for a one-year commitment. This helps us ensure job stability for our staff and underscores our commitment to creating lasting professional relationships.

4. **Partnership & Respect:** We see our relationship with you as a partnership. Our experts bring their unique skills, knowledge, and experience to your projects, and we ask that their professional judgment be respected. If there are aspects of the work that don't meet your expectations, let's discuss and collaborate to find solutions.

5. **Conflict Resolution:** We encourage open communication and expect any issues with our team members to be addressed directly with them. We're all professionals here, and we trust you'll handle any disagreements or conflicts responsibly and constructively.

6. **Management & Mediation Services:** If you require additional management or mediation support, we can provide these services at three times our normal rate to account for the added complexity and effort.

7. **Rush Work:** We understand that sometimes you need things done urgently. For work required with less than 30 working days' notice, we'll apply a rush fee, starting at 1.25x our regular rate for 30 days' notice and scaling up to 4x for a one-day notice.

8. **Administrative Fee:** To help us cover the operational costs of our nonprofit, we apply a 10% administrative fee to all contracts. This allows us to continue providing high-quality services and contributing to public interest causes.

By engaging with us, you acknowledge and agree to these terms. Thank you for your understanding and for the opportunity to collaborate with you on your important work.
