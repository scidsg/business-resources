# Work Philosophy
As an organization, we want to have a measurable impact in our focus areas - press freedom, activism, LGBTQ+ rights, and accessibility technology. But how many times have you experienced that anxiety of feeling that you need to be productive in front of a computer, even when you've already completed your work? We want to bring more balance into our professional relationships with employers intentionally.

With clear expectations, and thoughtful, non-reactionary planning, we can set a stable roadmap that gives people the time and space to work in the best ways for themselves.

Expectations:
- Meet your deliverables and milestones
- 1 weekly recurring standup
- 1 monthly cross-functional work demo
- 1 quarterly all-hands
- 1 annual all-hands planning
- Ad-hoc meetings as needed

There are no expectations of 40-hour work weeks or 5 or 4 days per week. You shouldn't be penalized for proficiency and efficiency if you can deliver your work in 20 hours. Likewise, if you love the projects we work on, you may occasionally put in a 50-hour week. It's not for us to decide how you work.

We hope this is a living model to which other organizations can commit.
