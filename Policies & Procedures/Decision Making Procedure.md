## Science & Design Board of Directors
A Board of Directors is a governing body that guides corporate strategy, profit distribution, and selecting/ compensating/ terminating leadership. 
Our Board of Directors is the decision-making body of representatives from each membership class.

Venture capital investors often control the Board of Directors for tech platforms without worker or user representation. 
Science & Design's Board of Directors aligns around "co-determination." Workers and users are affected by the decisions of tech platforms, 
so they should have a seat at the table.

Our Board consists of elected representatives to serve as stewards of the interests of each stakeholder group of Science & Design.

**Founders:**
Science & Design's founding Board of 5 Directors

**Contributors:**
Contributors elect 2 Directors

**Donors:**
Donating Members elect 2 Directors

## Elections 

Our first election for board representation will be held in Q2 of 2023.
