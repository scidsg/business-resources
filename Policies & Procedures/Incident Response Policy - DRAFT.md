_Intentionally unlisted on the main page. Not meant for wide distribution until out of draft mode._

## 1. Policy Statement

This Incident Response Policy provides a well-defined, organized approach for handling any potential threat to computers and data, as well as taking appropriate action when the source of the intrusion or incident at a third party is traced back to the organization.

## 2. Purpose

The goal of this policy is to ensure that any security incident is managed efficiently and effectively, in a way that minimizes damage and reduces recovery time and costs.

## 3. Scope

This policy applies to all incidents involving any data, information systems, networks, or devices that store, process, or transmit organizational data.

## 4. Policy

4.1 **Incident Response Team (IRT):** Our organization will maintain a dedicated IRT responsible for incident handling. The IRT should include representatives from IT, legal, HR, and communications departments.

4.2 **Preparation:** All relevant personnel should be prepared and trained to respond quickly and effectively to any incidents that arise.

4.3 **Identification:** An incident will be identified by a report from an intrusion detection system, a member of staff, a third party, a user, or the IRT. Upon identification of a potential security incident, the reporter should immediately notify the IRT.

4.4 **Classification and Prioritization:** Upon notification, the IRT will assess the situation to determine whether an incident has occurred and, if so, the type, extent, and severity of the incident.

4.5 **Response:** Once an incident has been classified, the IRT will respond according to the established plan. This may involve isolating systems, gathering further information, and initiating containment strategies.

4.6 **Reporting:** All incidents must be reported in a timely manner. Depending on the severity and nature of the incident, it may be necessary to notify the management team, law enforcement, affected clients, and public relations.

4.7 **Recovery:** The IRT will ensure that affected systems or services are restored to normal operation as quickly as possible, while ensuring that no traces of the incident remain.

4.8 **Post-Incident Analysis:** After recovery, the incident will be analyzed to learn from the event and future incidents are prevented or mitigated.

## 5. Review and Update of the Policy

This policy will be reviewed and updated regularly, or as required by changes to systems, procedures, or regulatory requirements.
