# Hush Line - Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

## Introduction
Hush Line is a free, open-source, self-hosted anonymous tip line that makes it easy for organizations or individuals to install and use. It's intended for journalists and newsrooms to offer a public tip line; by educators and school administrators to provide students with a safe way to report potentially sensitive information, or employers, Board rooms, and C-suites for anonymous employee reporting.

## Scope
This vulnerability disclosure policy applies to all versions and components of the Hush Line project, including the main application, official plugins, extensions, and third-party dependencies maintained by the Hush Line team.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities
If you discover a vulnerability in Hush Line, please submit a report [here](https://tips.hushline.app/submit_message/security).

When reporting a vulnerability, please include the following information:
- A detailed description of the vulnerability and its potential impact
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
- Any proof-of-concept code, scripts, or screenshots that demonstrate the vulnerability
- Your contact information (name, email address) for further communication

## Validation Process
Upon receiving a vulnerability report, the Hush Line security team will thoroughly validate the reported vulnerability. This process may involve reproducing the issue, assessing its impact, and determining the affected components or versions of Hush Line.

## Response and Communication
- The Hush Line security team will acknowledge receipt of the vulnerability report within 2 business days.
- We will provide an initial response regarding the validity and acceptance of the report within 5 business days.
- The team will work on developing a fix or mitigation for the vulnerability and keep the reporter informed about the progress and estimated timeline for resolution.
- Once the vulnerability has been resolved, we will notify the reporter and coordinate the public disclosure of the vulnerability details.

We will make every effort to keep the reporter informed throughout the vulnerability handling process and credit them for their responsible disclosure, unless they wish to remain anonymous.

## Disclosure Policy
Hush Line follows a coordinated disclosure approach. We kindly request that reporters maintain confidentiality of the vulnerability details until we have had sufficient time to investigate, develop a fix, and prepare for public disclosure. We aim to address reported vulnerabilities within 90 days of the initial report, depending on the complexity and severity of the issue.

In some cases, the disclosure timeline may be extended if coordinating with other affected parties or if the vulnerability has a severe impact. We will communicate any changes to the timeline with the reporter.

The vulnerability details will be publicly disclosed once a fix has been developed and deployed to production. We will coordinate with the reporter on the timing and content of the public disclosure.

## Recognition
While we do not currently offer a monetary reward program, we believe in giving credit where it's due. Unless you wish to remain anonymous, we will publicly acknowledge your contribution to improving the security of Hush Line once the vulnerability has been resolved.

## Legal Safe Harbor
Hush Line will not take legal action against individuals who report vulnerabilities in accordance with this policy. We consider responsible vulnerability research and disclosure to be a valuable contribution to the security of our project and the broader open-source community.

However, we request that researchers:
- Make every effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, or interruption of our services
- Refrain from accessing or modifying user data without explicit permission
- Provide us with a reasonable amount of time to address the reported vulnerability before publicly disclosing it
