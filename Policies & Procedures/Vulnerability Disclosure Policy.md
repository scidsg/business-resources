# Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

## Introduction

Science & Design is a 501(c)(3) non-profit building free and open-source software for the public good. As such, our community is critical to identifying any issues that have gone undiscovered by our team.

## Scope

This vulnerability disclosure policy applies to all versions and components of the product suite from Science & Design, including the main application, official plugins, extensions, and third-party dependencies maintained by the Science & Design team.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a vulnerability in our products, please submit a report [here](https://tips.hushline.app/submit_message/security).

When reporting a vulnerability, please include the following information:

- A detailed description of the vulnerability and its potential impact
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
- Any proof-of-concept code, scripts, or screenshots that demonstrate the vulnerability
- Your contact information (name, email address) for further communication

## Validation Process

Upon receiving a vulnerability report, the Science & Design security team will thoroughly validate the reported vulnerability. This process may involve reproducing the issue, assessing its impact, and determining the affected components or versions of our software.

## Response and Communication

- The Science & Design security team will acknowledge receipt of the vulnerability report within two (2) business days.
- We will provide an initial response regarding the validity and acceptance of the report within five (5) business days.
- The team will work on developing a fix or mitigation for the vulnerability and keep the reporter informed about the progress and estimated timeline for resolution.
- Once the vulnerability has been resolved, we will notify the reporter and coordinate the public disclosure of the details.

We will try to keep the reporter informed throughout the vulnerability handling process and credit them for their responsible disclosure unless they wish to remain anonymous.

## Disclosure Policy

Science & Design follows a coordinated disclosure approach. We request that reporters maintain confidentiality of the vulnerability details until we have had sufficient time to investigate, develop a fix, and prepare for public disclosure. We aim to address reported vulnerabilities within 90 days of the initial report, depending on the complexity and severity of the issue.

In some cases, the disclosure timeline may be extended if coordinating with other affected parties or if the vulnerability has a severe impact. We will communicate any changes to the timeline with the reporter.

The vulnerability details will be publicly disclosed once a fix has been developed and deployed to production. We will coordinate with the reporter on the timing and content of the public disclosure.

## Recognition

While we do not currently offer a monetary reward program, we believe in giving credit where it's due. Unless you wish to remain anonymous, we will publicly acknowledge your contribution to improving the security of Science & Design once the vulnerability has been resolved.

## Legal Safe Harbor

Science & Design will not take legal action against individuals who report vulnerabilities in accordance with this policy. We consider responsible vulnerability research and disclosure to be a valuable contribution to the security of our project and the broader open-source community.

However, we request that researchers:

- Make every effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, or interruption of our services
- Refrain from accessing or modifying user data without explicit permission
- Provide us with a reasonable amount of time to address the reported vulnerability before publicly disclosing it
