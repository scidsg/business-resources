# Budgeting and Financial Planning Policy

## 1. Indirect Cost Allocation
In the process of preparing budgets for grant proposals, an indirect cost rate of 10% will be included to cover the administrative costs associated with the implementation of the grant. This rate will be applied consistently across all grants and contracts unless a specific funder policy dictates otherwise.

## 2. Financial Reporting Policy

Reporting of Indirect Costs: Indirect costs or administrative fees recovered from grants and contracts will be reported separately in the financial reports, in compliance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and the specific requirements of funders.
