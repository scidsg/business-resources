# Budgeting and Financial Planning Policy

1. **Indirect Cost Allocation:** In the process of preparing budgets for grant proposals, an indirect cost rate of 10% will be included to cover the administrative costs associated with the implementation of the grant. This rate will be applied consistently across all grants and contracts unless a specific funder policy dictates otherwise.

## 1. Accounting Policy:

1.1 Grant Accounting: For each grant received, a separate cost center will be established to track direct and indirect costs. Indirect costs will be allocated based on the approved indirect cost rate of 10%, unless a different rate is approved by the funder.

## 2. Financial Reporting Policy:

 2.1 Reporting of Indirect Costs: Indirect costs or administrative fees recovered from grants and contracts will be reported separately in the financial reports, in compliance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and the specific requirements of funders.
