# Reviewing Costs Incurred Under Grant Awards Policy

**Purpose:** The purpose of this policy is to ensure all costs incurred under grant awards are reviewed for reasonableness, allowability, and allocability, in line with federal regulations, grantor terms and conditions, and Science & Design, Inc.'s internal policies.

## **1. Policy:**

1.1 All costs charged to a grant must be necessary and reasonable for the performance of the award and be allocable thereto under these principles.

1.2 Any cost allocable to a particular grant may not be shifted to other federal award to overcome fund deficiencies, to avoid restrictions imposed by law or grant agreement, or for other reasons.

1.3 Costs must be consistently charged as either direct or indirect costs.

## **2. Procedures:**

2.1 **Budget Review:** Before incurring costs, the department head should review the grant budget to ensure the costs are allowable under the grant. If there are questions about the allowability of a cost, the department head should consult with the Grants Management team.

2.2 **Reasonableness:** Each cost should be evaluated for reasonableness. A cost is considered reasonable if the nature of the goods or services acquired and the amount paid for them reflect the action that a prudent person would have taken given the prevailing circumstances at the time the decision was made to incur the cost.

2.3 **Review and Approval:** Before costs are incurred, they should be reviewed and approved by the relevant department head and the Grants Management team. This review should ensure that costs are reasonable and allowable under the grant.

2.4 **Cost Allocation:** If a cost benefits more than one project or activity, it should be allocated to each project or activity based on the proportional benefit. The method of allocation should be documented and applied consistently.

2.5 **Documentation:** Documentation for costs should be maintained in accordance with the organization's Document Retention Policy. This documentation should include information on how the cost was determined to be reasonable and allowable, and the method of allocation, if applicable.

2.6 **Training:** All personnel involved in the administration of grants should be trained on the principles of reasonableness, allowability, and allocability, as well as the organization's procedures for reviewing and approving costs.

2.7 **Review:** This policy will be reviewed annually by the Board of Directors and the Grants Management team to ensure it remains compliant with federal regulations and grantor terms and conditions. Any changes to the policy will be communicated to all relevant personnel.
