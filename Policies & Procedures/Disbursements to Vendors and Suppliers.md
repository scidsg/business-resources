# Disbursements to Vendors and Suppliers

1.1 Approval of Purchase: Before any purchase is made, the need for the purchase and the selection of the supplier should be approved by the relevant department head.

1.2 Purchase Order: A purchase order (PO) should be created for the approved purchase, detailing the goods/services to be received and the agreed-upon price. The PO should be approved by the relevant department head or another designated individual.

1.3 Receiving and Inspection: Once goods/services are received, they should be inspected and matched to the PO to ensure accuracy.

1.4 Invoice Approval and Payment: The invoice should be matched to the PO and receiving documents. If all documents align, the invoice should be approved for payment by the relevant department head or another designated individual. Payments should be made within the vendor's payment terms to maintain good vendor relations and credit standing.
