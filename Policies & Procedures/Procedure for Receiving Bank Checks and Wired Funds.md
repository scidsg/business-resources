## 1. Receiving Bank Checks

1.1 **Check Receipt:** Upon receipt of a bank check, the receiving staff member should record the check in the organization's financial system with the check number, date, amount, payer's name, and purpose of the payment.

1.2 **Endorsement:** The check should be immediately endorsed "For Deposit Only" with the organization's bank account number.

1.3 **Safekeeping:** Until the check is deposited, it should be kept in a secure location, such as a locked drawer or safe.

1.4 **Check Deposit:** The check should be deposited promptly into the organization's bank account. The deposit slip should be scanned and saved in the organization's financial system.

1.5 **Recording:** The deposit should be recorded in the organization's accounting system, ensuring it is allocated to the correct fund, grant, or account as indicated by the purpose of the payment.

## 2. Receiving Wired Funds
