- Some 61% chose the option declaring that, “yes,” by 2035, digital spaces and people’s uses of them will change in ways that significantly serve the public good.

- Possible Solutions:

  - The creation of an internet version of public media along the lines of PBS and NPR;

  - “Middleware” that could allow people to set an algorithm to give them the kind of internet experience they want, perhaps without the dystopian side effects;

  - Online upvoting systems that favor content that could push partisans toward consensus, rather than polarizing them;

  - An internet “bill of rights” allowing “self-sovereign identity” that lets people stay anonymous online, but weeds out bots; and

  - “Constructive communication” systems set up to dial down anger and bridge divides.

## The psychology of online activism and social movements: relations between online and offline collective action

- However, most empirical evidence suggests that online and offline activism are positively related and intertwined (no digital dualism), because social media posts can mobilise others for offline protest. Notwithstanding this positive relationship, the internet also enhances the visibility of activism and therefore facilitates repression in repressive contexts.

- Although the internet may support online activism and its spread to offline protest, such increases in (online and offline) protest can invigorate repression.
